# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Dashboard
This repository contains my first data analysis project using Excel, where I explored sales data from a coffee shop to uncover key insights. The project includes data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to identify trends such as the busiest sales periods, most popular products, and the store with the highest revenue. The insights derived from this analysis can help in making informed business decisions.
